## 1. Software Engineering (CO - 301)  
#### Recommended books :  
1. [Software engineering, K.K Aggarwal, Yogesh Singh](https://goo.gl/DTRcC8) this the main and only text for the course.

#### Details :  
* The code files for the lab work can be found in [this](/SE/SE_LAB) directory.  
* As the lab work is project oriented, where your build on top of the work done in the previous lab, this should only be used as a guide to developing the work.  
* Most exam oriented text gets covered in class and the class notes are sufficient for passing.

## 2. Theory of Computation (CO - 303)
#### Recommended books :  
No single book can be recommended for this course as the scope for questions in the subject is vast.  
1. [Introduction to Computer Theory, Daniel I A Cohen](https://goo.gl/1xGcV3) this is the main text for theory.
2. [Theory of Computer Science: Automata, Languages and Computation, KLP Mishra](https://goo.gl/dpuX68) Follow thos book mainly for the examples and as a quick refresher for Cohen.  

#### Details :  
* There is no lab for this subject.  
* Class notes are sufficient only for getting a grasp of the concepts.  
* For theory Cohen[1] should be referred.  
* For practice, both Cohen[1] and KLP[2] should be referred.  


## 3. Computer Graphics (CO - 313)  
#### Recommended books :
1. [Computer Graphics, C Version 2E](https://goo.gl/x4U5DT) for theory and algorithms. This is the main text for the course.
2. [Schaum Outline Computer Graphics](https://goo.gl/NyaUzv) this is for numerical practice ONLY. DO NOT FOLLOW FOR THEORY.

#### Details :  

* The code files for the lab work can be found in [this](/Computer_Graphics/CG_LAB) directory.  
* The code work is in OpenGL. Instructions for installing OpenGL on Windows and Linux can be found easily.  
* If graphics.h is to be used, follow this [tutorial](/Computer_Graphics/instructions.md) for installing graphics.h on Linux.  


## 4. Pattern Recognition (IT - 307)  
#### Recommended books :  
1. [Pattern Classification, 2ed, Duda, Hart, Stork](https://goo.gl/cs4nXD) For the basics.
2. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Bishop](https://goo.gl/z8akS2) Reference book (recommended for in depth details).
3. [Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition](https://goo.gl/LGrg4Y) Support material.

#### Details :

* Apart from Duda, the other two books are fairly expensive(both nearly 4000 Rs.). It's recommended to get them from the library early as there's only a few copies of them available.  
* The lab work is done in Python and it is recommended to know/learn the basics early on into the course [Here](https://goo.gl/CLmSLi) is a good vedio series to do so. The Jupyter Notebooks for the labs can be found [here]()  
* It's also recommened to brush up your linear algebra and basic calculus as well.  


## 5. Computer Vision (EC - 353)  
#### Recommended books :
1. [Computer Vision: A Modern Approach, Ponce & Forsyth](https://goo.gl/vvXUVj) This is the main and only text for the course.

#### Details :
* There is no lab work for this subject (Because of it being an OEC).  
* It's better to learn OpenCV on the side even if there's no Lab involved.
* ->to be added<-

## 6. Professional Ethichs and Values (HU - 303)  
#### Recommended books :
1. [Professional Ethics, R. Subramanian](https://goo.gl/27yJra).
2. [A Textbook on Professional Ethics and Human Values, R.S. Naagarazan](https://goo.gl/itCrBc)

#### Details :
->to be added<-
